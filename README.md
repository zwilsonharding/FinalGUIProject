Zach Wilson
Barrett Montgomery

The program takes input in the form of a date, and assigns a seemingly random name to the user based upon said input.

Most of the project was done with pair-programming. Zach does not have access to Win 8, so most of the commits came from
Barrett, though they were in reality programmed by both of us.

No bugs are known to exist
